1) **Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces** - Use logistic regression, na√Øve Bayes, and word vectors to implement sentiment analysis, complete analogies, and translate words, and use locality sensitive hashing for approximate nearest neighbors.

2) **Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models** - Use dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, and word embeddings to autocorrect misspelled words, autocomplete partial sentences, and identify part-of-speech tags for words.

3) **Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models** - Use dense and recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, GRUs, and Siamese networks in TensorFlow and Trax to perform advanced sentiment analysis, text generation, named entity recognition, and to identify duplicate questions.

4) **Natural Language Processing with Attention Models** - Use encoder-decoder, causal, and self-attention to perform advanced machine translation of complete sentences, text summarization, question-answering and to build chatbots. Models covered include T5, BERT, transformer, reformer, and more.
